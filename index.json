Tabula Rasa is especially effective in n‐Cz wafers with oxygen concentration 15 ppma. Vacancies, self‐interstitials, and their aggregates result from TR as a metastable side effect. Temperature‐dependent lifetime spectroscopy reveals that these metastable defects have shallow energy levels ~0.12 eV. Their concentrations strongly depend on the ambient gases during TR because of an offset of the thermal equilibrium between vacancies and self‐interstitials. However, these metastable defects anneal out at typical cell processing temperatures ≥850°C and have little effect on the bulk lifetime of the processed cell structures. Without dissolving built‐in oxygen precipitate nuclei, high‐temperature solar cell processing severely degrades the minority carrier lifetimes to below 0.1 millisecond, while TR‐treated n‐Cz wafers after the cell processing steps exhibit carrier lifetimes above 2.2 milliseconds.","tags":[],"title":"Tabula Rasa for n‐Cz silicon‐based photovoltaics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.P.

We suggest a method that allows the characterization of oxygen-related defects, which are suspected to be on the scale of a few tens of nanometers, which, despite their small size, have a macroscale effect on the minority carrier lifetime. The method consists of a suite of microscopy technique applied together to a) locate the defects and map them in a statistically relevant area, b) measure their density, size and distribution within the wafer bulk, and c) study their morphology and chemical state. As a result, we can understand the root-cause behind the formation of the oxide-related defects, their gettering ability, so we can apply processing techniques to mitigate them.","tags":[],"title":"Oxygen-related defect characterization using correlative microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.R.

However, little is known about how charge-carrier lifetime and solar cell performance in LHPs are affected by extrinsic defects (i.e., impurities), including those that are common in manufacturing environments and known to introduce deep levels in other semiconductors. Here, we evaluate the tolerance of LHP solar cells to iron introduced via intentional contamination of the feedstock and examine the root causes of the resulting efficiency losses. We find that comparable efficiency losses occur in LHPs at feedstock iron concentrations approximately 100 times higher than those in p-type silicon devices. Photoluminescence measurements correlate iron concentration with nonradiative recombination, which we attribute to the presence of deep-level iron interstitials, as calculated from first-principles, as well as iron-rich particles detected by synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy. At moderate contamination levels, we witness prominent recovery of device efficiencies to near-baseline values after biasing at 1.4 V for 60 s in the dark. We theorize that this temporary effect arises from improved charge-carrier collection enhanced by electric fields strengthened from ion migration toward interfaces. Our results demonstrate that extrinsic defect tolerance contributes to high efficiencies in LHP solar cells, which inspires further investigation into potential large-scale manufacturing cost savings as well as the degree of overlap between intrinsic and extrinsic defect tolerance in LHPs and “perovskite-inspired” lead-free stable alternatives.","tags":[],"title":"High Tolerance to Iron Contamination in Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.A. Jensen","A.E.

In our previous analyses, titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W) were identified as potential candidates for LeTID. The addition of temperature dependence further constrains the defect parameters. Assuming constant defect parameters with temperature, we identify two possible sets of defect parameters: k = 23.9 ± 5.5 at Et-Ei = -0.21 ± 0.06 eV and k = 23.5 ± 5.6 at Et-Ei = -0.10 ± 0.07 eV. We consider our results in the context of published defect parameters identified by TIDLS in other LeTID samples, and we evaluate our results against reported defect parameter temperature dependencies for Ti and Mo. We conclude that Mo is most consistent with our measurements.

In this work, we study the recombination mechanism for thin and thick silicon heterojunction solar cells, and we discuss the potential of using more defective material to manufacture high performance thin solar cells. Modelling the performance of silicon heterojunction solar cells indicates that at open-circuit voltage the recombination is dominated by Auger and surface, representing nearly 90% of the total recombination. At maximum power point, the surface is responsible for 50 to 80% of the overall recombination, and its contribution increases inversely with the wafer thickness. The experimental results show that for lower quality CZ material with 1 ms bulk lifetime, 60 µm-thick cells perform better than 170 µm-thick cells. The potential efficiency gain is 1% absolute. The gains in voltage of using thinner wafers are significantly higher for the lower quality CZ material, 25 mV, than for standard CZ material, 10 mV.","tags":[],"title":"Thin silicon solar cells: Pathway to cost-effective and defect-tolerant cell design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.E.

To address this hypothesis, synchrotronbased X-ray techniques, including fluorescence and absorption near-edge spectroscopy, are employed. In as-grown industrial material, we observe collocated copper- and nickel-rich precipitates, which persist after firing and are below the detection limit after phosphorous diffusion. We conclude that precipitates decrease in size due to the firing process and that this may result in an increase in bulk interstitial metal concentration.

Here, the application of 2D and 3D neutron imaging is demonstrated as a means to investigate effects of environmental conditions on EEC performance. Changes in aqueous solutions that are vital to the operation of EECs have been directly observed in real time using neutron radiography (NR). These changes include uptake of aqueous solutions in electrode materials and in situ observation of water content during operation. The EEC structure has also been observed using ex situ neutron tomography. Initially samples constructed to simulate EEC geometry were imaged, and aqueous buffer solution uptake behavior was observed in carbon paper cell components. In follow-on studies neutron tomography was used to map regions of enzyme catalyst inks, de!ning active regions within the EEC electrode. The higher neutron attenuation of polymeric ink components enables this observation. Finally, in situ imaging of a prototype EEC pouch cell was performed using a standard chronoamperometry arrangement while performing real time neutron radiography. Neutron radiographs acquired during operation show a clear variation in transmission behavior, primarily due to drying. Together these studies demonstrate the applicability and attendant challenges of neutron imaging for the study of EEC performance and reliability.","tags":[],"title":"Ex Situ and In Situ Neutron Imaging of Enzymatic Electrochemical Cells","type":"publication"}]
